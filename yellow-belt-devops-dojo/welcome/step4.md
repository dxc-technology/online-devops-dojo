Throughout the modules, you will interact with the virtual team, in the
context of issues or pull requests. This is done through a [GitHub Application](https://developer.github.com/apps/about-apps/) 
which you need to "install" in your pet-clinic repository.

You will get a confirmation at the top of the browser: 
"**Okay, DevOps Dojo Bot was installed on the @your-shortname account**".
