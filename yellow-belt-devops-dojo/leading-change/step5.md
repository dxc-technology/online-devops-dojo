Paulo schedules a meeting with the Pet Clinic development team, during which he explains the ask from the leadership team to initiate a DevOps transformation.

He welcomes Chun and describes the role she is to play to help the team with the DevOps transformation.

Paulo invites Chun to introduce herself and asks her to share her top Learnings from the previous DevOps Transformations she has worked on with the team.

Chun explains that she is a coach, change facilitator and technologist, that she has been helping organizations make the transition from traditional development practices to DevOps practices and culture. She further explains that she is committed to growing the DevOps coaching community in the organizations she works with by leveraging her experience to coach others.

Chun's shares her top learnings from previous transformation efforts with the team:

* Culture eats Transformation for Lunch

* Tools are [least] important

* Leadership support is key

* Invest in a Small Enablement group

* Choose wisely what is mandated and top-down

* Don’t skip the Value Stream Mapping step

* Set overall goals/measures

* Create Improvement Themes

* Continuous Improvement via DevOps Kaizen NOT a Big Bang approach

* Focus on a small set of common capabilities / shared services

* Develop Champions, Change Agents, Coaches

* Start now and never finish

The team are excited and challenged by the ask.

Paulo thanks Chun for the overview and opens the floor to questions.
