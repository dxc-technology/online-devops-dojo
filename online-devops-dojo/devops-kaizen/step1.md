While the DevOps Kaizen module can be taken independently, it follows directly
on from the Value Stream Mapping module.

Hopefully you have followed our advice and taken the Value Stream Mapping (VSM)

This is the VSM which the Pet Clinic team created to represent the E2E flow of
their development process:

The team have gotten sponsorship from management to improve, and are now
wondering how to leverage the VSM as the starting point.
