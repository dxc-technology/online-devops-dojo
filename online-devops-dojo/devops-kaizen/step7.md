- Set the scope and limits of the Kaizen Event.
- Decided on a 6 weeks Kaizen event cycle with 2 weeks increments and aligned them with the teams current sprint cycle.
- Agreed to set time aside in the Scrum ceremonies to plan, discuss progress on and review DevOps Kaizen improvements.

Chun suggests the use of Improvement Themes to assess current state and define success

and explains that the Improvement Theme consists of five areas.

1. Improvement Theme Name
2. Now/Problem – Description of the current state
3. Definition of Awesome – The desired state 
4. Next Target Condition – X weeks from now, what will have changed?
5. First Steps – 3 slots which describe the first steps to be taken to address the delta between current and desired state

She further explains that the Improvement Theme should be a living document accessible to all stakeholders. The core Kaizen team should review the Improvement Theme once or twice per week, updating the theme based on completed and new identified actions.
