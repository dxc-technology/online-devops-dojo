## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Online DevOps Dojo** lab on DevOps Kaizen.  
If you have not completed the Welcome module you must do so before continuing
with this module.

## Purpose

The primary objective of the "DevOps Kaizen" module is to help you to understand the principles and benefits of DevOps Kaizen. This is to enable you and your team to use DevOps Kaizen (Continuous Improvement) as both a framework and as a repeatable process to help empower your team. You will learn how DevOps Kaizen can be used to identify and fix issues with, and to continuously improve your Value Streams.

The secondary objective is to give you an opportunity to participate in a DevOps Kaizen real world scenario using Katacoda in **your** Sandbox environment.

Remember the Sandbox is your personal clone of the Pet Clinic Repository. The Sandbox is the one which you created in the Welcome module. You are free to experiment in your Sandbox without fear of impacting the lab or other learners.

By the end of the lesson and lab, you will be able to

Explain what a DevOps Kaizen is.

* Describe the need for and business benefits of DevOps Kaizen
* Understand the process of conducting a DevOps Kaizen event
  * who should participate
  * how to identify focus areas to improve from the Value Stream Map (VSM)
  * set measurable objectives
  * define the Kaizen increment (short period 2 to 3 weeks)
  * specify what success looks like so progress can be tracked against objectives
  * reassess improvements and objectives at the end of each increment
  * update target conditions based upon progress and learnings from the Kaizen event
* Leverage DevOps/Lean toolbox of tools, technologies, practices and methodologies in a Kaizen increment.
