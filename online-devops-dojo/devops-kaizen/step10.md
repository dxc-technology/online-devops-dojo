Tina and the team came up with the following testing improvement theme:

## **Title**: Continuous Testing

| ![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/devops-kaizen/current-state.png) **Now/Problem**  |  ![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/devops-kaizen/target.png) **Next Target Condition**  |
|---|---|
| Testing is mostly manual, mainly performed after the development is completed, feedback on issues is too late in the process which in turn is leading to rework and delays | Introduce functional tests with Selenium and execute the tests from our CI pipeline |
| ![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/devops-kaizen/awesome.png) **Definition of Awesome**  | ![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/devops-kaizen/steps.png) **First Steps** |
| Any code committed to our source code management system would be continuously integrated via a Jenkins pipeline. <br/>The pipeline would execute of a comprehensive set of automated tests (continuous testing) against the code.<br/>These tests would include unit tests that cover 70 to 80% of the code and automated acceptance tests of key functional areas. | Add a stage in our pipeline which includes automated functional tests.  |
