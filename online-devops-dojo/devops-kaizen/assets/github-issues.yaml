  # DevOps Kaizen Improvement Theme

  ### **:green_book:  Now / Current State**

  Testing is mostly manual, mainly performed after the development is completed, feedback on issues is too late in the process which in turn is leading to rework and delays

  ### **:star: Definition of awesome**

  Any code committed to our source code management system would be continuously integrated via a Jenkins pipeline. 

  The pipeline would execute of a comprehensive set of automated tests (continuous testing) against the code, these tests would include unit tests that cover 70 to 80% of the code and automated acceptance tests of key functional areas.

  ### **:dart: Next target condition**

  Introduce Unit Testing and execute the unit tests from a CI pipeline.

  ### **:feet: First steps**

  Create the Pipeline, have it invoked when code is committed and execute some unit tests from the pipeline
