    When I worked in the Robotic Pets Assembly Plant we ran improvement events, you may recall I mentioned the similarities of those events to the VSM exercise we conducted.

    We do, indeed some of your contributions based on that experience greatly helped with the VSM.

    Cheers, so I presume to host the DevOps Kaizen events we need to organize something similar to those meetings, set aside a few days for the Kaizen planning, document the outcomes, assemble a team with a view to identifying and scheduling the improvements we want to make to our process?

    In principle yes, but I want to embed Kaizen into the fabric of our processes or day to day operations if you will.

    Sounds like you have a plan, care to share?
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    Of course, the VSM confirmed what most of us already knew. Our process is flawed and it needs to be improved, agree?
---
speaking: Selma
text: >
    Yes.

    We have already started that change with the introduction of Agile. Kudos to Santhosh and team for those efforts. Dan has been suggesting we move towards DevOps, and that too is underway with Chun supporting as the DevOps coach.

    I want to incorporate Kaizen Events into those initiatives.

    I like where this is going. What do you see as the main advantage to this approach?
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    I will let Chun answer that question.

    In a sentence it would be that continuous improvement would become part of our daily work, that it becomes second nature to us in all stages of our development cycle including architecture, planning, development, testing, security, deployment and operability.

    Putting my business hat on, I have to ask my two favorite questions of the team. When can we start? And when will we start to see the improvements?

speaking: Paulo

    No time like the present.

    Great but before we proceed, let's ask some questions to [student].
