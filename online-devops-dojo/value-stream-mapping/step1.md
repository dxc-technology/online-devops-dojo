Pet Clinic's merry bunch of people are now well underway on their DevOps
journey. They have defined Improvement Themes and are running regular DevOps
Kaizen events to address the delta between an ever improving current state and
the desired state also known as the definition of awesome.

They are from the disciplined application of the 3 ways of DevOps seeing
incremental but manifest improvements to their processes. This hasn't gone
unnoticed by the key stakeholders in the business, who are referring other
groups in the organization to the team to help them understand how this change
was carried out.

**Brenda** still demands more from the team in terms of functionality delivered
and quality of output. **Paulo** is still pressuring the team to commit to
delivering more story points in a sprint.

The difference now is that requests of that nature are not causing the panic of
old. Now stakeholder requests are being analyzed, incorporated into the
Improvement Themes and addressed via the DevOps Kaizen Events initiated
following the VSM exercise the team performed.
