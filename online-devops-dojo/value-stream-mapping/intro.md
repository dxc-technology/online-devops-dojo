## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Online DevOps Dojo** lab on Value Stream Mapping (VSM).

## Purpose

The primary objective of the "Value Stream Mapping" (VSM) module is to help you to understand the principles and benefits of VSM. This is to enable you and your team to use VSM to better understand your current processes to identify and fix issues with those processes.

The secondary objective is to give you an opportunity to complete a VSM real world scenario using Katacoda in **your** Sandbox environment.

Remember the Sandbox is your personal clone of the Pet Clinic Repository. The Sandbox is the one which you created in the Welcome module. You are free to experiment in your Sandbox without fear of impacting the lab or other learners.

By the end of the lesson and lab, you will be able to:

* Explain what a Value Stream is.
* Articulate what VSM is.
* Describe the need for and business benefits of VSM.
* Identify and select the initial Value Streams to address.
* Understand the process of conducting a VSM exercise.
  * what to include
  * what to exclude
  * who needs to participate
  * what are the outputs
* Use the VSM to help identify improvements that can deliver the greatest business value.
