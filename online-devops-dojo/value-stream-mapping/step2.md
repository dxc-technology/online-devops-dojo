Come with us on a journey, let us rewind and take to trip back in time to the Pet Clinic offices of a year ago. The reason for this trip is to better understand where the team were and how they used VSM with the support of their management to understand and change their end to end process.

Fade In ..

We open in an incident room strewn with coke cans, pizza boxes and stale air.

The team, tired and tense, are following a long couple of days spent addressing issues following an upgrade to a key system holding a post-mortem into the issues with the upgrade. The question at hand is why another major upgrade to the system was delivered late, prone to errors and suffered periodic performance issues.

**Brenda** is not happy, she is explaining to the team that this is not the first event of this nature and the impact to the business. She also outlines the effects issues of this nature are having on her and the teams credibility.

It is a not a pleasant meeting, developers are blaming testers, testers are blaming developers, project managers are pointing to infrastructure issues, admins are pointing to planning issues. The only thing everyone seems to agree to is that someone else is more to blame than they are for the issues encountered.

**Paulo** the product owner, who is relatively new to the company proposes VSM as an approach that could be used to help identify the root causes of the issues and provide a basis to start improving from. Paulo informs the team VSM was used extensively to great effect in his previous company. The team, eager to explore a potential solution to the challenges faced, are curious (if slightly skeptical) that a solution can be found.

Paulo engages **Chun** the DevOps coach to host a session to outline VSM to the team.

Chun explains that an IT Value stream is the process including all steps a team follows to get changes and feature implementations into production thus delivering business value. VSM is the process of aligning the entire team around an agreed understanding of the steps, processes, timings and constraints in a Value Stream, thus helping the team to identify, agree and prioritize improvement steps. 

VSM focuses the DevOps work on improvements which achieve the largest business value, thus helping organizations create blueprints in support of Lean transformations.

This is **Value Stream Mapping**.
