With the support of management, the team have scheduled a two day session to create the VSM. 

Representatives from all stakeholders in the value stream, i.e. the Pet Clinic software development process, have been included. 

The purpose of this session is to discuss, discover and agree a shared understanding of what is currently happening in the E2E process. 

Paulo who is leading the exercise has stressed the importance of resisting the temptation to document what is to supposed to happen but to focus on what is actually happening.

This is the VSM ![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/devopsdojoassets/valuestreammap.png) they created to represent the E2E flow.

The process the team followed to create the VSM can be described as

1. **Identified the Value Stream to be mapped** - Pet Clinic Software Development Process.

2. **Empowered the team** - ensured all stakeholders represented.

3. **Agreed the problem statement** - Deliver defect free software that meets business requirements quicker and more frequently.

4. **Agreed the scope** - what parts of the process VSM was to include and just importantly, what parts it would not.

5. **Walked the process documenting** - agreed the process steps, took multiple passes through the process.

6. **Collected process data** - lead times, processing times, complete and accurate work per step.

7. **Agreed the VSM** - represented the current state of the Pet Clinic Software Development Process.

8. **Analyzed the VSM and agreed the way forward** - which the remainder of this module will cover.
