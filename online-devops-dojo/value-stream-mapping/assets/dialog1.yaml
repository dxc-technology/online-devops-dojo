    VSM sounds interesting what exactly is it?
---
speaking: Chun

    A Value Stream describes the process used to create and deliver goods, services, solutions and in our case, software. While a Value Stream Map is a pictorial representation of a value stream.

    A VSM will enable us to see the end to end flow of software from idea to delivery including branches, feedback loops and queues in our process.

    We already understand our process why do we need to draw it? We already work as fast as we can, this just seems to be a distraction from writing code.

    I agree we all understand the general process as it applies to our functional areas and our interactions with our direct upstream and downstream activities but I think we don't have a shared understanding of the complete end to end flow.

    The understanding I am referring to would include the nature of handoffs between functions, the lead times, the activity times and the quality of work reaching each of us. I think that lack of understanding is contributing to the problems we have been experiencing.

    Maybe another way to look at this is to agree what contributes to the time it takes for a feature to be delivered?
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Exactly, basically for a work item the Total Duration = Processing Time (Actual Time spent working ) + Waste Time (Handoffs etc.)

    A VSM is a pictorial representation, using a standard set of symbols, of an end to end process including lead and activity times for all steps in the process.

speaking: Dan
text: >
    OK I think I am starting to understand where you are going with this, what do we do with the VSM once we create it?
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    We use it to identify and eliminate waste, waste is any non value add activities in the value stream including handoffs, rework, manual activities, wait times etc.

    We need to do that yesterday, how do we begin?

    First, let's ask some questions to [student].
