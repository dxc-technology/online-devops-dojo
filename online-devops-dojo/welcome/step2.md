The **Online DevOps Dojo** has several characters which play a role throughout the modules. Here are the bios of the crew. Get to know them, their challenges and their dreams so you can share in their achievements as our story unfolds.

### Charlie (CEO)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/charlie.png)

**C**harlie is the **C**EO of the company; a technology entrepreneur, investor,
and philanthropist.

Charlie is intent on disrupting the world of Pet Clinics and sees DevOps as key
to the company's plans.

### Chun (Coach)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/chun.png)

**C**hun is a **c**oach, change facilitator and technologist. She has been helping organizations make the transition from
traditional development practices to DevOps practices and culture supported by tooling, and processes to increase the release
frequency and quality of software.

She grew into the role of a DevOps Coach. Chunâ€™s coaching is based on her experience gained from working from startups and
multinational companies. In her previous roles she was an avid outdoors person and adrenaline junky, lover of fun, hater of being
on-call and worked extensively to automate as much as possible the build, test, package and deploy process to ensure that the
systems were created with a LessOps model in mind.

Having identified the opportunities DevOps offers she decided to step up and coach others, to practice what she preaches. Chun is
committed to growing the DevOps coaching community by leveraging her experience to support / coach others.

### Brenda (Business)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/brenda.png)

**B**renda is from the **b**usiness. One of her goals is to help grow the company. The more she sells, the happier Brenda gets, and
key to this is the availability and functionality of the Pet Clinic application. Of course, she is aware of engineering capacity,
technical constraints, security and all that but her primary objective is to deliver often, introduce great products for owners and
their pets, together with features which will leave Pet Clinic's competitors far behind. She is competitive, but has also developed
empathy for the team. She is extremely proud of her two golden retrievers, Bonnie and Clyde.

Brenda works mainly with Paulo, the product owner. She gets to explain what she wants to Paulo and Paulo helps the team to
prioritize the work so that Brenda can get what the business needs incorporated into the application.

She participates in end-of-sprint demos, where she appreciates the opportunity to interact with other members of the team. Between
the sprint planning and the sprint reviews, Brenda feels she's engaged often - and sometimes too often - by the team. She would like
to rely on Paulo more.

Brenda heard once from Selma, the security contact in the team, when important customer information got hacked. Not a pleasant
experience for her, for the company, and definitely not for the customers. They traced it down to a hacker named Hal, who has been
in communication with the team via anonymous e-mail.

Brenda is keen to take the Pet Clinic in to new growth areas. A recent foray into Fair Trade pet products was very encouraging so
she is working work with Paulo to get epics and stories created in the team's backlog so that the required enhancements to the Pet
Clinic application are ready in time for the planned marketing launch in support of these new product lines.

### Paulo (Product Owner)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/paulo.png)

**P**aulo is the **P**roduct Owner, he is a cat person and volunteers at a local
animal rescue center.

Paulo works with Brenda to define the vision of the product. He prioritizes the
backlog with Santhosh the Scrum master and the Scrum team.

Passionate and outcome-driven he is a product owner with twenty years experience
in all aspects of product delivery. He has experience across multiple
industries, in addition to entrepreneurial experience having run his own company
in the past.

Sometimes, Paulo feels that Brenda does not really know what she wants and that
she changes her mind too quickly. "This is because of a rapidly changing
environment", Brenda says before uttering the magic words that expose the
Achilles heel of every product owner
- [Principle 2 of the Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/) states:

> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

To the bemusement of the team, Paulo replies that this is INCONCEIVABLE! :) and then works to facilitate the changes via the
backlog. After which the team points out to Paulo that he keeps using that word and that the team [doesn't think it means what he thinks it means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D58LpHBnvsI).

As a key stakeholder in the Agile process, as part of his product owner responsibilities and from his interactions with Brenda, Paulo
has the vision of what is to be built, why it is to be built and in what order it is to be built. He conveys that vision to the
Scrum team who regularly and rather unfairly questions it in his opinion.

### Santhosh (Scrum Master)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/santhosh.png)

**S**anthosh is the **S**crum Master. He is the advisor to and facilitator for the agile development team. He helps everybody
including our cast (Brenda from the business, Paulo the product owner, Tina the tester and Dan the developer) understand Scrum
theory, practices, rules, and values.

Santhosh is keen to learn and understand DevOps tools and processes to better understand the nuances in the approach and
responsibilities of Scrum teams adopting DevOps and Scrum teams who are not adopting DevOps.

Traditional Scrum teams consist of people who deliver the potentially releasable increments at the end of a Sprint. Whereas Scrum
teams adapting DevOps target the whole value stream so the team includes all the people who work a Product Backlog Item (PBI) in the
end-to-end value stream. A DevOps Scrum team could include some or all of the following: analysts, UI/UX designers, developers,
operations people, sysadmins, data scientists and site reliability engineers. A DevOps Scrum team works together, collaboratively as
one unit, to deliver value to their customers.

Santhosh works diligently as a Scrum master to protect the team from anything -
typically requests originating from Brenda or Paulo that may distract them from
the active sprint deliverables - and to remove anything that impedes the flow of
value delivery from the team to the business.

### Adam (Site Reliability Engineer)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/adam.png)

**A**dam is a System **A**dministrator who is transitioning to the role of Site
Reliability Engineer (SRE). SRE is a discipline that combines software and
systems engineering to create ultra-scalable and massively distributed,
fault-tolerant systems.

As he transitions into the SRE role, Adam is keen to learn and understand best
practices in the SRE and DevOps fields so he can help shape the SRE culture in
the company. He has started to work with Brenda to understand the needs of the
business and with the Scrum team to ensure they have robust solutions in place
for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining their applications and their cloud
environments so they can meet the needs of their customers.

He also works closely with Selma the Security Officer to ensure the security of
the company's software and applications. Adam suspects that Hal may have an
inside man. Adam has a particular set of skills so he is working on a plan to
look for the hacker, to find the hacker, to ... the hacker.

Adam has a pet parrot whose favorite phrase is "Have you tried turning it off
and on again?" and is working with Brenda to expand the Bird, Reptile and Small
Animal product lines offered by Pet Clinic.

### Dan (Developer)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/dan.png)

**D**an, one of the Pet Clinic development team, is a full stack **D**eveloper originally from Mos Eisley. He has worked as a senior
developer for a number of years, most recently for First Order Inc., and has mentored new hires and interns in a number of the
companies he has worked in. He has a keen interest in learning and applying new technologies including Docker, Kubernetes, and new
programming paradigms using his weapons of choice PHP and Node.js on cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure to solve complex business
problems.

He is also keen to learn more about the practical applications of test-driven development, continuous integration and build
pipelines. When not jumping out of buses on Fortnite Battle Royale, he admits to a slight obsession learning about serverless
computing and microservices.

Dan's workmates still fondly recall the fun and games which ensued when Shelob, his pet tarantula, got lose in the Pet Clinic office
on *"Bring Your Pets to Work"* day.

Sometimes, Dan feels that Brenda expects too much, changes her mind too often, and does not pay enough attention to the quality of
the functionality being released. Dan works closely with Tina the tester; they regularly debate if a story has been implemented in a
way that meets the stated acceptance criteria and delivers value to the Pet Clinic application users.

### Tina (Tester)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/tina.png)

**T**ina is a **T**ester. Her motto, which she is apt to quote often, is "You can't test in quality; you have to build it into the
DNA of the software development process."

Tina worked until recently in a traditional testing role, where testing was performed after the development stage of the application
assembly line. She is aware that the role of and skills required by a tester are changing. Tina realizes that testers have to become
comfortable working with code and be able to analyze it. She appreciates that testers need to work within the Scrum teams in order
to ensure quality is built into the software development process during the two week sprint cycle.

She is keen to expand her strong testing skills, to become more technically adept, and to learn more about coding so she can start
working on test automation. By expanding her skills to become a test automation expert she hopes to play a more active role in the
sprint cycle.

In her spare time, aside from finding and documenting bugs in Dan the Developer's code, she enjoys hiking near the Reichenbach
Falls. She thinks the advent of the cloud is the greatest thing to hit the testing world in years, if only because it prevents
developers like Dan from saying "it is working on my machine".

Like Paulo she volunteers at the animal rescue center and helps run the Pet Clinic community engagement project that supports that
shelter.

### Selma (Security)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/selma.png)

**S**elma is the company's **S**ecurity Officer, and is the proud owner of a German Shepherd called Arnold. Selma is currently under
pressure due to the sudden spike in security vulnerabilities being identified as a result of Hal the hacker's efforts.

Rather than considering the SecOps aspect of DevOps as an afterthought, Selma wants the team to keep security in mind in everything
they do by:

- Building security into the applications.
- Protecting applications and data within the DevOps automation chain.

Whilst admittedly distracted by the cat and mouse game she is currently engaged with Hal the hacker on, Selma is more than mindful
of the fact that security approaches and technologies must be systemic to the applicationsâ€™ data handling, transportation and
storage mechanisms. Selma is working with Paulo the product owner to ensure security stories, tasks and acceptance criteria are
incorporated and prioritized in the product backlog.

She is troubled by Paulo's apparent lack of concern of the potential ramifications of the recent hack, but does appreciate his help
creating stories to address the vulnerabilities exposed. She also wishes he would stop his recent and rather annoying habit of
humming the theme tune to Mission Impossible when discussing how to best address the potential for negative publicity around the
hack.

### Hal (Hacker)

![](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/hal.png)

**H**al is a white hat **H**acker, engaged by the company to find and expose vulnerabilities in the company's applications. A
vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a Threat Actor, such as an attacker, to perform unauthorized actions within a
computer system. Hal's job is to find those vulnerabilities before the bad guys do, so stories can be created to close them and
worked into the Development backlog with the assistance of Paulo the product owner.

Hal, upon learning that Aristotle was not Belgian and that the London Underground was not a political movement, was struck with a
passion to seek out information wherever it may be. Hal is sure that the truth is out there. After a number of close encounters with
the legal institutions of the state and some volunteer work in the community, this passion for information has over time
transitioned into a well paying gig as a White Hat Hacker. Hal helps companies to help themselves.

Paulo the product owner is aware of Hal the hackers secret identity but has been sworn to secrecy by Charlie. The rest of the team
meanwhile whilst slightly puzzled by the volume of security stories Paulo has recently started creating, are nonetheless very
impressed with Paulo's savant like knowledge of security which he attributes to an online security course he recently took.

Hal, tired of people asking him to open the pod bay doors, has been trying to get people to call him by the code name Neo instead.
But most people still call him Hal.

Hal has no pets due to a wide range of allergies.
