You are about to enter another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. A journey into a wondrous land of imagination. Next stop, the **Online DevOps Dojo**!

In addition to a Welcome and Setup module, this course is made up of 7 open source modules on DevOps culture and practices.

* Leading Change
* Version Control
* Continuous Integration
* Shift Left On Security
* Value Stream Mapping
* DevOps Kaizen
* Post Incident Practices

## Katacoda environment

The modules make use of Katacoda environments. Those are ephemeral environments which are created just for you, on the fly. They
will time out after one hour. The good news is that you can explore around and get out of the script: it is your own environment.

So, go grab a cup of your favorite caffeinated beverage, close your email, put your phone on plane mode, and let's get started!

## Welcome module

In this Welcome module lab, we will get you started and setup a dedicated environment for you, to allow you complete the labs for
the other modules in the **Online DevOps Dojo** at your own pace.

First, to begin let us introduce you to the story of a business formed by the CEO Charlie, a DevOps team, an application and its
delivery chain (continuous delivery pipeline).

Once upon a time, not so long ago in a galaxy not so far away...
