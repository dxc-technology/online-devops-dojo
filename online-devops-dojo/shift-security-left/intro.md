## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Online DevOps Dojo** module on shifting security left.  
If you have not completed the Welcome module you must do so before continuing
with this module.

## Purpose

The primary objective of the "Shift Left on Security" module is to help you to
understand the principles and benefits of Shifting Left on Security and enable
you and your team to Shift Left on Security in your daily work.

The secondary objective is to give you an opportunity to complete a Shift Left
on Security real world scenario using Katacoda in **your** Sandbox environment.

Remember the Sandbox is your personal clone of the Pet Clinic Repository. The
Sandbox is the one which you created in the Welcome module. You are free to
experiment in your Sandbox without fear of impacting the lab or other learners.

By the end of the lesson, you should be able to:

* articulate the need to Shift Left on Security,
* integrate Security Testing in the daily work of the Scrum team as part of a
  CI/CD pipeline,
* describe how to reduce surface areas of risk and enforce consistency in the
  the application of security testing,
* understand the need to provide traceability of production artifacts,
* explain the importance of using commercially available and/or open source
  tools which the security team have reviewed and tools rather than custom
  solutions for security testing.

## Definition

ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 6 mentions of *shift left* already... what does this mean?

Usually a Continuous Integration pipeline is represented by several stages
starting from left to right. Hopefully you already have security checks a some
point. Shifting left means to run these security checks as early as possible.
Fail fast and do not waste time to pass other stages if you can detect earlier
that you have to rework your code.
