## Steps

* Navigate to your copy of the pet clinic application to find  [`pom.xml`](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-9876-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/#pomfilebranch), in the same `deps-check` branch from the pull request.
* Click on the pencil icon in the top right corner to edit the file.
* Locate the `spring-boot-starter-cache` dependency, and remove the line with `<version>`.
* Commit the change in this `deps-check` branch, in the context of the pull request.
* The build will trigger automatically
* Navigate to [Jenkins](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/pet-clinic/activity) to see the results of the build.
* This time, the OWASP check should come out with no error: everything good! âœ”

## The pipeline still fails?

At this point you have resolved the vulnerability we wanted you to resolve.
If there are additional vulnerabilities identified you either fix them using
the process which follows or you can ignore any additional items and proceed
with the rest of the module.

You will need to walk the dependency tree. Let's first go to the correct branch in the repository:
* Go to the terminal window
* `cd ~/pet-clinic`{{execute}}
* `git pull`{{execute}}
* `git checkout deps-check`{{execute}}

Now let's look at the dependency tree:
* `mvn dependency:tree`{{execute}} (or `mvn dependency:tree | egrep --color=auto 'my-vulnerable-dep|$'` to highlight "`my-vulnerable-dep`" without version number)
* Look for the dependency that has been identified as vulnerable in the OWASP dependency check report .
* Walk up the tree and find the library which includes the vulnerable dependency. In this example, `databind` is vulnerable:
![](/online-devops-dojo/assets/online-devops-dojo/shift-security-left/mvn-tree.png)
* In this example, you need to locate `spring-boot-actuator-autoconfigure` in `pom.xml` or update an higher level dependency.
* Go to https://mvnrepository.com/ to find a new version of that library. Using the smallest minor revision is always preferred to not destabilize the code. That said, automated tests provide a good safety.
* Update the `pom.xml` file with the new version - `nano pom.xml`{{execute}}
* Push the updated version:
  * `git add pom.xml`{{execute}}
  * `git commit -m "Fix dependency"`{{execute}}
  * `git push`{{execute}}
* Check the execution of the pipeline and the results.
* Repeat until dependency check is green.

Note that a training session lasts one hour maximum. Beyond, since your repository is saved in GitHub, you will just need to restart the module (F5) and fast forward.
