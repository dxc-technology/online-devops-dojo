Prior to their DevOps transformation the post incident practices in the Pet Clinic team were reactive, painful, and a constant source of stress for employees.

A large event or outage would occur. Depending on the severity of the issue there would be a mild organized panic or a mad disorganized panic. The incident would be resolved. Everyone would say there has to be a better way of doing things. The team would make some vague plans to get together and discuss how best to improve things. Life would take over with the normal day to day routine of development, testing, and operations reasserting themselves - until the next large event or outage when the cycle would repeat.

The Pet Clinic team had the best intentions and the right idea, in that to get better at Incident Management they needed to commit to getting better at Incident Management. However, they lacked the will, resources, and time to get better between events.

This was not a recipe for success, and had knock-on effects in terms of stakeholder confidence in the team, staff morale, work life balance, and ultimately staff retention.

Following a another large scale outage, the team members are keen to leverage the opportunity that the DevOps transformation offers to improve their post incident practices at all stages of the incident life cycle.

The 5 phases in the typical incident life cycle are

* Detection
* Response
* Remediation
* Analysis
* Readiness/Kaizen

The team wants to work with **Chun** to create a ‚Äúcode of conduct‚Äù aligned with DevOps principles to help them better manage incidents in all phases of the typical incident life cycle.

The phases for pre and post DevOps transformation incident practices will largely stay the same, what will change is the manner in which the phases are addressed using DevOps culture, processes, and methodologies.

This is **Post Incident Practices**.
