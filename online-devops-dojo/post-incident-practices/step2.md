A production incident has occurred which took the Pet Clinic application offline, thus breaching agreed SLAs with the customers and exposing the company to potential financial penalties.

The team - **Adam** the Admin/SRE, **Dan** the Developer, and **Tina** the tester have investigated with the assistance of **Brenda** from the business & **Selma** from security. The issue has been resolved, a patch prepared, the patch has been deployed, and the application is back online.

The team as per their post incident management practices holds an incident post-mortem.

It is not a pleasant meeting. The questions at hand include how another major upgrade to the system was delivered late, was prone to errors, and suffered from periodic performance issues.

These are the practitioners.
