_Ladies and gentlemen: the story you are about to hear is true. In some places the names have been changed to protect the innocent._

**Basil** from the business is not happy, he is explaining to the team that this is not the first event of this nature and outlining the impact to the business. He also outlines the effects issues of this nature are having on his and the team's credibility.

Responses include:

**Arkwright** _"Oh that was after the admin team deployed a change **Sybil** from security approved."_

**Dougal** _"The development team could have fixed the issues prior to deployment if **Ted** and the testers had told us about them."_

**Dougal** and the Developers are blaming **Ted** and the testers. The testers are blaming the developers. **Polly** the product owner is pointing to infrastructure issues caused by **Arkwright** and the admins who in turn are pointing to scheduling issues caused by **Sam** the Scrum master.

The only thing everyone agrees on is that someone else is more at to blame than they are for the issues encountered.

The conversation revolves around _who did what_ and _who approved it_ rather than on _why the issue occurred_ and _what in the system can be done to prevent similar issues occurring in the future_.

The DevOps enablement team **Paulo** and **Chun** are interested observers in the meeting. They arrange a follow up meeting for the next day to share their observations with the team.

Chun discusses the post-mortem process with the team. She explains the issues she saw with the post-mortem, the primary one being that it was conducted in the wrong manner with a focus on attributing responsibility for the outage rather than focusing on the root cause of the outage.

Chun further explains that a blameful culture is very harmful as it can cause a myriad of problems including:

* Staff retention

* Truth being hidden

* Culture where no one wants to speak out

* Leaders not knowing what is really happening

* Management by fear

The team admits that their practices might be improved and ask Chun how she thinks they should have conducted the post-mortem.
