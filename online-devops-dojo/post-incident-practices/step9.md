>> Which of the following options shows the correct calculation for MTTR? <<
(*) MTTR = MTTD (Detect) + MTTI (Isolate) + MTTF (Fix)
( ) MTTR = MTTD (Detect) * MTTI (Isolate) * MTTF (Fix)
( ) MTTR = (MTTD (Detect) + MTTI (Isolate)) - MTTF (Fix)
( ) MTTR = MTTD (Detect) - (MTTI (Isolate) + MTTF (Fix))
