## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Online DevOps Dojo** Post Incident Practices module.

## Purpose

The primary objective of the "Post Incident Practices" module is to help you leverage DevOps principles to get better at Incident Management. Additionally you will learn how to establish a Safety Culture, conduct blameless post-mortems and create a “code of conduct” to help your team manage incidents in all phases of their life cycle.

The secondary objective is to give you an opportunity to virtually participate in a Post Incident Practices real world scenario using Katacoda.

If you have not completed the Welcome module you should do so before continuing with the Post Incident Practices module.

By the end of the lesson, the learners should be able to

* List the 5 steps in an incident life cycle.
* Understand the role of DevOps in creating effective post incident practices.
* Explain the importance of focusing on continuous learning.
* Explain the need to continually enact improvements to incident management practices.
