# Conclusion

Congratulations, you have completed the Post Incident Practices module of the **Online DevOps Dojo**!

Before moving on to the next module in this course or going back to work please take a few minutes to consider how you and your colleagues can establish a Safety Culture, conduct blameless post-mortems and create a “code of conduct” to help you better manage incidents in all phases of their life cycle.
