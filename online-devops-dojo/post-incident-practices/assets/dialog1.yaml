    Let me start by focusing on what was done well in relation to the incident post-mortem because it is important those practices continue.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    The post-mortem was scheduled immediately after the incident was resolved which is as per best practices.
---

    What else are we doing well?
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    From what we saw, you had all the right people in the meeting. Representatives from the teams who developed, tested, and deployed the application. 
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    The people who reported the outage, identified the problem, found the root cause of the issue, and the people who resolved the issue.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    You created a timeline of the outage and started to get people's perspectives on the events that led to the outage and the outage itself.
---
speaking: Santhosh
text: >
    Good to hear but I think we all know what you are going to say next - at that point it all went off the rails and it degenerated into a finger pointing exercise.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    Exactly.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    High performance teams create a Safety Culture where people are empowered to act, expected to act, and rewarded for taking smart action.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Where mistakes are not punished, so that people give open and frank accounts of their actions which may have contributed to the outage.
---
speaking: Santhosh
text: >
    And how does your suggestion for a Safety Culture apply to the post incident post-mortem?
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    The postmortem should be blameless and be focused on learning as much as possible from an event or outage. It should be used to instill a culture of action in the team.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    OK so how might have the post-mortem we held yesterday played out if it was held as a blameless post-mortem in a Safety Culture?
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Interesting question, I will need some volunteers to participate in a little role playing exercise to explain.
---
speaking: Team
text: >
    Groans and starts looking at their feet.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Laughs and tells everyone not to be shy - the exercise will be fun.
---
speaking: Team
text: >
    Of course it will.

    First, let's ask some questions to [student].
