## Continuous Integration runs

Go to Jenkins to see Continuous Integration happening: https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/pet-clinic/activity/

![CI Pipeline in Jenkins](/online-devops-dojo/assets/online-devops-dojo/continuous-integration/ci-blue-ocean.png)

This will take some time to:

* Download the dependencies of the Pet Clinic application
* Build the application to generate a package
* Run unit tests
* Deploy the result to an ephemeral Docker container

## The mechanics

As the pull request is created, a series of automated actions happen in the background:

* GitHub notifies Jenkins of the code change thanks to the [web hook](https://help.github.com/articles/about-webhooks/), which you can see in your repository settings at [https://github.com/[your_username]/pet-clinic/settings/hooks](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-9876-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/#hooks). A web hook is used to notify other applications about events in the GitHub repository, such as a Pull Request being submitted.
* Jenkins reads the content of the [`Jenkinsfile`](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/) at the root of your repository. The Jenkinsfile is the file which has the implementation of your applications' continuous integration pipeline.
* The stages and steps in the Jenkinsfile are executed on the Jenkins server.

## Tasks

* Review the result of the pipeline: note the "build" step has caught the error we introduced in a previous step.
* Click on the step which is in error and review the logs of the error.
