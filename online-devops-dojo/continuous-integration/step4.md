## Tasks

* Under "**Commit changes**", enter a short description for the change. A good
  practices is to have the ID of the user story associated with this task in the
  short description like so: `Fix #1: add horse names in database`{{copy}} - for
  user story #1.
* Choose "Create a **new branch** for this commit [...]" option and give the
  branch a meaningful short name such as `us-1-horse-db`{{copy}}. Note that the
  user story ID is used again in the branch name: this is to foster traceability
  and help maintain a clean history of commits to the repository.
* Click "**Propose File Change**": this will trigger the creation of a pull
  request.
