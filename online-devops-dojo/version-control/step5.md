# Create a Pull Request

![Dan](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/version-control/dan.png)

> Although we pushed the new code back to GitHub, it is still in its isolated branch,
> not impacting the work of others in the team.
> It's now time to seek feedback and create a pull request so that the changes
can be reviewed.

## Steps

* Go to GitHub, in the pet clinic repository (check the terminal window for a link to the issues module in your pet-clinic repository)
https://github.com/YOUR_SHORTNAME/pet-clinic (use your actual GitHub user name).
* Click on 'Compare & pull request'.
* Check that the title of the pull request is `#1: add support for horses in database initialization` which corresponds to the first line of your commit message.
* Enter the comments and review your changes and click on 'Create pull request'.

✏ **Note**: The title of the pull request, which references a user story in GitHub matters: once the pull request is merged, the corresponding user story (GitHub issue #1) will be automatically closed.

✏ **Note**: A GitHub pull request can be used to merge Branches (as is the case here) or to import changes from a Forked repository. For a brief explanation of the pull request workflow see [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
