# Understanding the user story

> I created a user story, and it is visible in our backlog. We want to link the 
> code changes to that user story, so that we can ensure traceability and make 
> work visible.

## Steps

* Go and check the pet clinic backlog (check the terminal window for a link to the issues module in your pet-clinic repository).
* Identify the user story number (should be `1`)

# Create a feature branch

> To make sure we isolate work, we use feature branches. We name this short lived
> branch after the ID and name of the user story

## Steps

* Change directory into the cloned repo: `cd pet-clinic`{{execute}}
* Create `us-1-horse` branch to cover user story 1 about adding horses: `git checkout -b us-1-horse`{{execute}}

> This branch is a short lived (e.g. one day) feature branch. We use this feature branch to
> get feedback from continuous integration (automated checks and gates) and from peers. 
> This allows us to work in isolation (without impacting others), yet sharing the work in progress.

# Make changes

> Now, let's implement the user story by making some changes in the code. We will first start by adding `horse` as a pet type.

## Steps

* In the editor to the right, head to `src/main/resources/db/hsqldb` folder and  open `data.sql`
* Below `INSERT INTO types VALUES (6, 'hamster');` around line 23, add a new line to insert the horse entry: `INSERT INTO types VALUES (7, 'horse');`{{copy}}  
  Note that changes are saved automatically.
* Check the branch in which you are working: `git branch`{{execute}}
* Check the status of the file changed: `git status`{{execute}}

> Good! I can see that you are working in the context of the feature branch and that
> the file has changed, ready to be added: Git reports that changes are not staged for commit yet.
