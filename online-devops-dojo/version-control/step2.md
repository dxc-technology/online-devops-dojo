We will now download a copy of your own personal pet-clinic GitHub repository locally by issuing a `git clone`. 
To streamline this process, you will get asked a few questions and a script will do it for you.

**Note**: you will re-use GitHub's "Personal Access Token" you created in the Welcome module. 
If you need to generate a new one, go to [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and save it for later.

Let's go ahead and prepare our environment, click this:

 `./prepare.sh`{{execute}}

...and wait for the "Click on 'CONTINUE'" message.
ðŸ’¡ **TIP**: ðŸ¦Š Firefox user? Use <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>INS</kbd> / <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>INS</kbd> to copy/paste your Personal Access Token in the window.
