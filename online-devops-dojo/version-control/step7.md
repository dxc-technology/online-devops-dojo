## Steps

* Go and check the pet clinic backlog to inspect the user story (check the terminal window for a link to the issues module in your pet-clinic repository)
* Verify that there is a link between the user story and the pull request which implements the user story
* Verify that the user story is not closed. Don't close it yet.
