## Steps

* Go and check the Pet Clinic backlog to inspect the user story (check the
  terminal window for a link to the issues module in your pet-clinic repository)
* Verify that there is a link between the user story and the pull request which
  implements the user story
* Verify that the user story is not closed. Don't close it yet.
