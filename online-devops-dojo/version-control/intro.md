## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Online DevOps Dojo** lab on Version Control.  

## Purpose

The primary objective of the "version control" module is to understand the
benefits of version control. The secondary objective is to expose a working
example of a branching model for version control: the pull request / feature
branch.

If you have not completed the Welcome module, you must do so before continuing
with this module.

By the end of the lesson and lab, you will be able to:

* articulate the benefits of version control,
* implement version control for your own activity,
* understand the mechanism of pull requests / feature branches.
