## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Online DevOps Dojo** lab on Version Control.
This course has been adapted from original content designed by [DevOps@DXC](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-devops-dojo/).

## Purpose

The primary objective of the "version control" module is to understand the benefits of version control. The secondary objective is to expose a working example of a branching model for version control: the pull request / feature branch.

By the end of the lesson and lab, you will be able to:

* articulate the benefits of version control,
* implement version control for your own activity,
* understand the mechanism of pull requests / feature branches.
