Charlie likes to pilot initiatives in the Pet Clinic business for a number of reasons:

* As an animal lover the Pet Clinic business is close to his heart so he is keen for it to succeed.

* The business operation is big enough to test and verify new initiatives before rolling them out to other companies in his portfolio.

* The business operation is small enough so that if initiatives prove not to be successful, they have been evaluated in a way that results in little or no impact to the larger companies in his portfolio.

* He believes in the Pet Clinic team, and is confident that if they are empowered to change, they will in turn empower others.

Having decided to make the shift to DevOps and initiate a DevOps transformation, he first instructed a few of his trusted lieutenants to read **The DevOps Handbook** and **The Phoenix Project**. Charlie then gathered his lieutenants together, explained his desire to disrupt the Pet Clinic business and the role he envisaged DevOps playing in that disruption.

The team recognized quickly that a move to DevOps involved more than a change in tooling, that it also required a cultural shift and recommended that a coach be appointed to help the Pet Clinic organization with the required cultural transformation.

After an extensive search they appointed **Chun** as a DevOps coach to help guide the team through the transformation and they asked **Paulo** the product owner to work with her in support of the DevOps Transformation.

The team realized that DevOps Transformations like all other change initiatives would inevitably conflict with ongoing business operations and as such would involve both disruption and innovation, and that for this disruption and innovation to succeed that they needed to create a Safety Culture.

A Safety Culture has been defined as _“a culture where employees can tell the boss bad news.”_ in a culture of this nature there is a focus on accepting that the team are working on complex system, that things will go wrong and that - when they do - blameless post-mortems are conducted to determine _what_ rather than _who_ caused the problem.

They were also aware that while the core transformation team Chun and Paulo would need to commit most of their time to DevOps work including training, coaching and mentoring, that the non-core team also needed to be allowed adequate time to allocate in support of the transformation for it to succeed.

Charlie hopes that Chun and Paulo will in time build a pool of coaches from the team who in turn will empower more coaches in the wider organization to lead the change required in his wider portfolio of businesses.

This is **Leading Change** and these are the change agents
