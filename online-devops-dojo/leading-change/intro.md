## Welcome!

Welcome to the **Online DevOps Dojo** Leading Change module.

## Purpose

DevOps Transformations like any other transformational activity can be challenging as enacting changes at the scale required can be hard, time-consuming, and require persistence.

The primary objective of the "Leading Change" module is to help you to understand that a large factor in the success of DevOps transformations is driven by the organization's ability to empower people to lead change at the different levels in the organization.

While there are challenges in Leading Change in support of DevOps transformations the rewards are quickly evident as the team and the wider organization begin to experience the benefits which accrue from a successful DevOps transformation.

The secondary objective of the module is to give you an opportunity to virtually participate in a Leading Change real world scenario using Katacoda.

If you have not completed the Welcome module you must do so before continuing with the Leading Change module.

By the end of the lesson and lab, you will be able to:

* Understand the need for change.

* List the 3 "ways" of DevOps and the role they play in DevOps transformations.

* Explain the role of DevOps coaches to help the organization adapt DevOps patterns, practices and tools.

* Describe the significance of empowering team members at all levels of the organization as change agents.

* Appreciate the importance of allocating both resources and time to allow the change to succeed.

* Outline the need to establish a safety-first culture, supporting change and experimentation during a DevOps Transformation.

* Articulate one potential approach to help ensure a successful DevOps Transformation.
