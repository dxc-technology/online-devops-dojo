With Chun's coaching and Paulo's guidance, and the engagement and support of the executive team, the group decided to start focusing on the following areas:

* Version Control

* Continuous Integration

* Shift Left on Security

There are dedicated modules in the **Online DevOps Dojo** which cover each of these topics in detail. The modules cover the topics in the context of the journey which the Pet Clinic team undertook as part of their DevOps Transformation.

Our hope is that you will find the modules useful and enjoyable, and that they will help you to empower yourself as change agent within your own team.
