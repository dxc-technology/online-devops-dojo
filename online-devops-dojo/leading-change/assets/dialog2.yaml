    This all sounds wonderful, but how do we start?
---
speaking: Chun

    In one sentence by assessing current state, defining what awesome would look like, and putting a plan in place to incrementally address any deltas identified between current state and awesome.

    I am reminded of the old quote "When eating an elephant take one bite at a time."
---
speaking: Chun

    Exactly. In our case each bite would be comprised of a two week continuous improvement event. These events are also known as DevOps Kaizen events. But I am getting ahead of myself. Let me answer Santhosh's question first.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Santhosh, we would start by assessing current state of the development process using Value Stream Mapping (VSM).
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    VSM will give us a shared understanding of the current process, with some key process metrics for each step in the process. These metrics would include lead time, processing time and % C/A which is the % complete versus accurate work received by each step in the process from the previous step in the process.

    We should be able to conduct a VSM exercise, I suspect it will be an interesting and productive exercise for the team.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Good, but remember we need representatives from all groups with an interest in the process to take part.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    Got it, I will reach out to the upstream and downstream groups to make sure they engage.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Then having come to an agreed understanding of the current process, we as a group need to define what awesome would look like.
---
speaking: Tina
text: >
    Awesome?
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Yes, collectively we need to agree what a perfect process looks like. Awesome is our target condition.
---
speaking: Dan
text: >
    And how do we plan on reaching that target?
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    One bite at a time, or to be precise, via a series of continuous improvement events also known as Kaizen events. DevOps Kaizen events focus on improving customer/client outcomes by making incremental improvements across the entire value stream.

    I know it is a lot to take in, but I am confident with Chun's coaching, with the support of our leadership and your commitment we will transform our operation for the better.

    Before we proceed, to ensure we are on the right path, let's ask [student].
