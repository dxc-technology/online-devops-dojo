Before embarking on the DevOps transformation Chun works with the team to create their DevOps Manifesto.

The Pet Clinic development team's DevOps Manifesto is comprised of a set of foundational values and supporting principles. 

The manifesto outlines how DevOps will be used by the team in support of the incremental development and rapid delivery of high-quality working software to their customers in the business.

**Pet Clinic Development Team's DevOps Manifesto**

* **Optimized**: We optimize end to end. No local-only optimization.

* **Inner Source**: All of our code is Inner Source. Our work is visible.

* **Scientific**: We formulate hypotheses; validate them with experience and data, continuously testing.

* **APIs**: Resources are controlled by APIs. Everything as code (version control, peer reviewed, automatically tested).

* **Pipelines**: All our changes go through our continuous delivery pipelines: application, compute, storage, DB, network, OS. No alternative.

* **Teams**: Integrated, empowered, self organizing teams.

* **Trust**: We value trust and responsibility. But we verify – through the CI/CD pipeline.

Based on the manifesto the team agree to prioritize the following activities:

* Source Code Management

* CI/CD Pipeline

* Test Automation

* Documentation as code

* Infrastructure as code

* Safety Culture
